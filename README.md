# Streamira

Streamira is a self-hosted music streaming service dedicated to modularity and redundancy. With a focus on a decentralized daemonization of music hosting. Not only is Streamira an organizational daemon, but it plans to be a subsystem of client and web services. Another primary feature will be an extensible API.

## Developmental Plans and Information

Streamira is a personal project, and while it has the eventual plans of being another part of the self-hosted ecosystem, it is purely for self-educational purposes. All of the following are purely plans, and are subject to change as soon as development begins.

### Daemon Information

The daemon for streamira is central for the project. Everything else is entirely non-neccessary, with the web application able to run seperately on any machine, and all device clients purely stand-alone an able to work with any seperate streamira installation. This could possibly allow for the sharing of a streamira installation, allowing communities to share music with a multi-user subsystem. The decentralized design is pivotal to this purpose, and the program will be bulit under this philosophy
